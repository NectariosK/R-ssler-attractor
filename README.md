# R-ssler-attractor
This repository/project deals with an explicit algorithm for the implementation of Runge-Kutta method of order 4 on the Rössler system.

The Rössler attractor is the attractor for the Rössler system, a system of three non-linear ordinary differential equations originally studied by Otto Rössler. These differential equations define a continuous-time dynamical system that exhibits chaotic dynamics associated with the fractal properties of the attractor. The attractor has some similarities to Lorenz attractor but is simpler and has only one manifold. Otto designed the attractor in 1976.
